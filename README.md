# PathQuest 
## Overview
PathQuest is a dynamic website designed to visualize prominent path-finding algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A*, providing users with an interactive platform for understanding and comparing these algorithms in real-time. Leveraging HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, PathQuest offers an educational experience in algorithmic exploration.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of BFS, DFS, and A* path-finding algorithms.
- Interactive controls for adjusting algorithm parameters and exploring different scenarios.
- Maze generation using recursive backtracking algorithm, enhancing technical depth and versatility.
- User-friendly interface for an improved learning experience.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathquest.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Choose an algorithm from the provided options (BFS, DFS, A*).
4. Customize parameters such as start and end points, obstacle placement, and animation speed.
5. Click the "Visualize" button to observe the algorithm in action.
